Surprised I didn't have a notes file in this repo but here's one.
-
I have a deep learning (CNN + SGD Nueral Net) example up and running in
a different repo. It requires images placed in each of:
    * training (1000)
    * evaluation (1000)
    * validation (1000)

So I need to make a new interim function in make_dataset, maybe something
like generate_three_data_splits, that creates those in interim.

From there it's a matter of making sure they're named properly (fake, real) with
a prefix. Let me check that one class svm can be batch learned and that
it can take neagtive examples....

okay, the one class i was aware of does not but there is a sgd one class (linear)
and, also, I should look at the reference example

Okay, so the reference example, here: https://hackernoon.com/one-class-classification-for-images-with-deep-features-be890c43455d
Doesn't seem to really take in account negativer data except isolation forest
has a contamination parameter

Let me double check what the CNN does
okay so the CNN needs data laid out in training, evaluation, and testing
and generates features on that into output
so it should look liek this:

make_dataset has a new function, generate_three_data_splits
this function creates a 
training set of only real kente images
a validation set of some real and some fake kente
a testing set of some real and more/some fake kente
---
okay so the quickest way to this is to modify interim/main not to delete (only main should),
copy out real to trainnig, and a mix otherwise to validation, testing

Then I can run features as normal

TheN I can run whichever/whatever of the above (even do parameter grid search if I care to)
k, let's do the first part...
-
note, I'm wiping the virtualenv,
doing
```
pipenv shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

which works (but is pretty ugly)
